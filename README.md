# Runner-game

I made this project in Pygame by following a tutorial (see credits).
I really like programming as a hobby and I also like playing games. By coding games I'm combining this.
My first programming language was Python, so it was a logical step to learn Pygame.

I learned a lot from this project, namely:
- I learned how Sprites work
- I understand better how OOP works
- I learned about collision detection
- I understand better how coordinates and placing objects work

I hope you enjoy the game!
